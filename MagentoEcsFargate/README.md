# Containerizing our Magento stack

This directory contains only architecture and installation steps. For more details, please check the [blog](https://medium.com/i-love-my-local-farmer-engineering-blog/containerizing-our-magento-stack-on-aws-81bba5850a6e) 

## Prerequisites
1. **NodeJS (v. 12+)** NodeJS is required for running and installing AWS CDK. You can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
1. **AWS CDK (v. 2.24.1)**: This solution uses AWS CDK for deployment. If you aren't familiar with CDK, please install its [prerequisites](https://cdkworkshop.com/15-prerequisites.html) and follow the  [Python workshop](https://cdkworkshop.com/30-python.html) first.   

## Architecture
To understand what this solution will deploy, we will start from the original architecture with virtual machine deployed on prem

![](.README_images/on-prem-architecture.png)

The solution uses Amazon ECS on Fargate to host the Magento App, Amazon RDS for MariaDB and Amazon Opensearch as dependencies.

### !!! This example is provided as a sample and rely on HTTP by default, which should never be used in production system . To use and [encrypted traffic/ HTTPS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/application/create-https-listener.html), please follow the HTTPS prerequisites below

## Components 

The main components of these solutions are in the folder magento_platform :

1. `magento_platform_stack` will set up AWS VPC and Security groups
2. `magento_db_stack` will set up the Amazon RDS for MariaDB.
3. `magento_es_stack` will set up the Opensearch cluster.
4. `magento_app_stack` will set up Amazon ECS cluster on Fargate to host the Magento Application.  

## HTTPS Prerequisites 

1. Create a HostedZone in Amazon Route53 or use and existing one (ex. mydomain.com)
2. Create/Use a certificate in Certificate Manager based on the previous HostedZone in Route53 (ex. public certificate on *.mydomain.com)
3. Replace #CERTIFICATE_ARN# in magento_app_stack.py by the arn of the certificate created in the previous step
4. Replace #HOSTED_ZONE_ID#, #HOSTED_ZONE_NAME# in magento_app_stack.py with the id and name of the HostedZone of step 1.
5. Replace #SUB_DOMAIN# in magento_app_stack.py by the sub-domain of your mangeto app (ex. magento in https://magento.mydomain.com)

The URL create will be https://#SUB_DOMAIN#.#HOSTED_ZONE_NAME#/ (output MagentoHostnameHTTPS of the NestedStack MagentoAppStack) 

## Installation steps

1. cd MagentoEcsFargate (if not already)
2. python3 -m virtualenv venv
3. source .venv/bin/activate
4. pip3 install -r requirements.txt
5. cdk deploy --all
6. In CloudFormation console, get the output "MagentoHostnameHTTP" from the NestedStack MagentoAppStack and connect to http://#MagentoHostname#/admin with magento_user. For the password retreive the value of "passwordMagentoUser" in Amazon Secret Manager in the AWS Console 

## Need to know 

We have 2 environment variables commented in the magento_app_stack. They need to remain commented during the first initialization of the platform :

`MAGENTO_SKIP_BOOTSTRAP` : Whether to skip performing the initial bootstrapping for the application. Default: no
`MAGENTO_SKIP_REINDEX` : Whether to skip Magento re-index during the initialization. Default: no
